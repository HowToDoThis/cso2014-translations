One year after the incident happened in Lex's laboratory, Unknown machine sound is starting to come out from the ruined facility factory nearby.
Guards entered the factory as they felt suspicious about it but contacts with them were lost afterwhich.
Hence, specialists invaded into the factory, but it turned out to be a place which tranforms the discarded corpse to zombies. 
Rumour has it that the unshrinkable zombies are becoming stronger each day...


Humans: Stay alive from zombies' attack until the support troops arrived. One of humans will be turned into a zombie, so watch out for all the players around you. Kill all the zombies!
Zombies: Humans that turned into zombies have to attack all humans in order to turn them into zombies. Do note that zombies are stronger and faster than humans.
