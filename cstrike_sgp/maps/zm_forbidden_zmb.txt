Nearby an illegal chemical research area
There is a facility to dispose remaining chemical waste from the research. However, it has been stopped for a pretty long time.
Now, this place becomes a resting ground for zombies that strengthened from various chemical wastes.

Human: Either stay alive for the remaining round time or annihilate all zombies.
Zombie: Infect all humans into zombies. Zombies are stronger and faster than humans.
