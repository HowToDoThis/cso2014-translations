After the VanGuard Laboratory’s collapse...
The remaining troops of David Black and Erica have gone missing while they were performing the mission.

Meanwhile, there was a team who retrieved an important research document from the ruined VanGuard Laboratory.

An unidentified man and his troops headed to the Polar Regions with the retrieved item.
It looked like the plan was working smoothly although it did not have a clear reason and destination.

However, as always, the danger appeared suddenly. 
They arrived at the wrong destination due to an unknown infection incident while they were heading to the Polar Regions.

The unidentified team has been searching for ways to escape as they were chased by unknown creatures and their screaming...

Goal
