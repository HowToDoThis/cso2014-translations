The scent of despair fills the cemetery and chances of survival to the next daylight looks grim.

Remaining human survivors from the last zombie's invasion has turned the situation around in their victory.

Forced to the losing end, the zombies are gathering for their final attack.

Few zombies have managed to retreat unscathed from the human's sudden attack and have escaped into the basement under the cemetery.

"We cannot miss this golden opportunity to annihilate all the zombies!", exclaims one human.

The human survivors arm themselves for the final pursuit to wipe out the undead.

It will not be long before they realise their grave mistake...

Human: How can there be such huge basement here?

Zombie: We have blocked the exit... We will annihilate all of you!
