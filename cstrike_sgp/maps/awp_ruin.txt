Ancient Ruins (Ruin) - Annihilation
Plan/Level Design: Nexon
Texture/Modeling/Modification: Nexon

One of our sniper team that was sent into the jungle to raid the secret base of the Terrorists is ambushed. They have been contacted by a Terrorist sniper team near the ancient ruins.
With both teams losing contact to base, their only survivor chance is to engage with their sniper weapons.

Goal: Get rid of all of the opposing side's snipers.
