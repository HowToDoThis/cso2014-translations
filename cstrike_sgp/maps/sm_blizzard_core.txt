Cold Fear - Core:Beast 
Planned and created by: Nexon
Graphics by: Nexon


The Counter-Terrorist and Terrorist forces found mysterious cores while they were battling each other in the Polar Regions.

They began research on the cores. As they realised that those cores have a mysterious power, they decided to destroy the other party’s core to gain sole control over core energy.

However, their battle has been ongoing due to the barrier generated by controllers that were installed for controlling the powerful energy of the core...

The agents who received prolonged exposure to fragments created from the core started to mutate while they were fighting against each other. Therefore, the battle has taken on a new aspect and the outcome is unknown...

Goal:
Destroy the enemy’s core. 
The core is protected by a barrier that is created by a controller.
You can attack the core for a while if you attack and disable the controller, thus removing the barrier. However, the controller will re-activate the barrier after 20 seconds.
