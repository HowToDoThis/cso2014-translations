Zombies have escaped Rex Laboratory, the only way to survive is to work together to push the invading creatures back to where they came from.

Humans: Survive the Zombie's attacks or eliminate all Zombies within the stipulated time. Shots at Zombies slow them down, momentarily.
Zombie: Zombies are to infect all humans till there are no more standing! Zombies have higher physical strength and speed compared to humans.
