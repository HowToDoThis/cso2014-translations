To rescue the survivers left behind in the ReX research institute B-1, the emergency team has to take a detour through block C, which contains military training facilities.
But when they try to enter B-1 through block C-5 they are attacked by unknown creatures.
The emergency team and creatures try any means to get out of there, but this only results in them waking up an abysmal creature...

Humans: Survive the zombie assault until backup arrives. Keep an eye on your comrades since any of the humans can turn into zombies. You can kill all zombies.
Zombie: Humans turned into zombies have to attack all humans to turn them into zombies. Zombies are stronger and faster than humans.
