Cs_assault

Assault is a hostage rescue map that pits the Terrorists inside a large garage where they must defend against two ground entrances (Front entrance and Back door),
 and another entrance on the roof. This map is relatively small, so it is suitable for small to medium groups.

Terrorist Objectives:
Eliminate the Counter-Terrorists before they rescue the hostages.

Counter-Terrorists Objectives:
Escort the hostages to the rescue zone.
