De_cbble

Similar in style and play to Dust, Cobble is another defusing map set in an ancient manor house - which the Terrorists are of course trying to destroy.
Combat can occur in both the wide open courtyards and tight corridors of this map, but it is essential for the Counter-Terrorists to put their opponents down as quickly as possible, 
as if the Ts can get the bomb planted in the courtyard, it becomes fairly easy for them to hold it against the Counter-Terrorists.

Terrorist Objective:
Plant the bomb at either bombsite A or bombsite B as indicated on the mini-map. Prevent the Counter-Terrorists from defusing the bomb.

Counter-Terrorists Objective:
Prevent the Terrorists from successfully detonating the bomb.
