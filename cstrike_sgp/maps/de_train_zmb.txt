Train - Zombie

In the middle of the fight between Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists, strange creatures appear that look like zombies, having obviously escaped from the ReX Research Institute. The humans have to combine their forces to stay alive.

Humans: Either stay alive for the rest of the time or kill all zombies.
Zombie: Humans turned into zombies have to attack all humans to turn them into zombies. Zombies are stronger and faster than humans.
