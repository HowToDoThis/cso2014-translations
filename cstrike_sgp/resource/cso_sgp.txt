"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto01"   "Welcome to Counter-Strike Online.\nThis training facility is designed to help trainees to learn basic tactical maneuvers.\nFollow the arrows on the ground to proceed.\nFirst, we will learn the basic movements."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto02"   "Counter-Strike is a first person shooter, meaning everything on the screen is\ncentered on your character.\nTo move forward and backward, left and right, press the W, A, S, D key respectively.\nDiagonal moves are possible when you press more than one move keys at the same time."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto03"   "Now you will go through an obstacle course."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto04"   "The obstacle in front of you will block your movement.\nPress the Space key to jump it over."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto05"   "You cannot jump the next obstacle over.\nInstead, you can crouch through the desks.\nTo crouch, hold down the Ctrl key."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto06"   "While crouching, your accuracy improves.\nTake advantage of this bonus when you're engaged in a\nlong range fight."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto07"   "The box in front of you is similar to what you have seen before, only taller.\nWhen a normal jump cannot overcome an obstacle, the 'Duck Jump' might do the job."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto08"   "The Duck Jump is called so because you have to\njump and duck (crouch) at the same time. To perform this action,\n press the Space key to jump and hold down the Ctrl key to crouch.\nIf you release the Ctrl key before you land, you might not overcome the obstacle."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto09"   "Now jump over the boxes using Duck Jump.\nIt is one of the most essential skills in Counter-Strike."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto10"   "Let's climb a ladder this time.\nA higher ground is an advantage in a fight.\nLadders are important as they let you safely reach such places."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto11"   "To climb the ladder, hold down the forward (W) key until you are at the top of it.\nClimb the ladder now."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto12"   "You can go down a ladder the same way you climb.\nBut in this case, you can press the jump (Space) key to jump down at any time.\nNote that you may take fall damage if you jump from a place too high from the ground."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto13"   "You will now learn how to fire weapons.\nNo matter what mission you play, you need a weapon.\nIt's the most important equipment in Counter-Strike.\nTo win an engagement, you need to know how to shoot.\nTake the M4a1 on the table."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto14"   "The M4a1 can be equipped with a silencer by a right-click.\nA silencer significantly reduces the report.\nIt is very useful when you want to surprise enemy."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto15"   "Shoot the target in front of you until it is destroyed.\nLeft-click to fire the rifle.\nOnce you destroy the initial target, a new one will appear in the next lane.\nDestroy 3 targets."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto16"   "If you feel the recoil is out of control, try burst-fire by firing 2-3 rounds at a time."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto17"   "You have destroyed all targets.\nNow you are prepared to learn the missions in Counter-Strike Online.\nGet in the elevator, the exit."

MM ?? :??\n\n We might be annihilated due to the sudden attack from Drone during the airplane transportation if not for Red Lizard 'Jim', who allow us to ride onto the Blaze. Secret reports were obtained that 'Noman', the guy 'Jim' trusted the most, has betrayed the mercenary .\n'Jim' looked very anxious after he heard that his base camp has been attacked.\n\n We have decided to leave early as we had to transport the samples safely. We will, hence, reorganize our remaining support troops and dispatch them to the base camp.\n\n - From the diary of the transportation supply troop commanding officer, 'Victor'"

Has the transportation troop led by the commanding officer, Victor escaped safely?\n\n I have never regretted applying for this mission, so that i can stayed here sniping enemies that tried to cross the river. I believe that my comrades who have applied this mission will have the same thought as me.\n No one will ever get to cross the river with us around!\n\n- - From some soldier's diary who has received the Order of Military Merit in the future "

"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_701"		"Gerard: We arrived at some place like a machine room, but there is no way to move anymore!"
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_702"		"Jim: Let me check with GPS. Umm?! You are just at my feet?!"
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_703"		"Gerard: At your feet?!"
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_704"		"Jim: If I explain to you, our coordination is overlapped but, I'm outside."
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_705"		"Gerard: Umm, we must be at the basement machine room."
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_706"		"Jim: You know that we cannot fly to the basement with the helicopter, right?"
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_707"		"Gerard: It seems like the concrete floor is not solid, we should be able to blow it up."
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_708"		"Jim: Yes. Try to get out from there and see the sunlight again, my friend."
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_709"		"Gerard: Okay! Plant the bomb here, soldier!"

//After planting the bomb
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_710"		"Gerard: Let's blow it up now. Stand back, everyone!"

//After coming down (or after passing the shortcut gate)

"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_720"		"Gerard: I'm sorry, but that is the dead-end again."
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_721"		"Jim: Are we only looking for the dead-end on purpose? Haha��"
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_722"		"Gerard: Wait a minute.. What's this vibration?"

//After boss cut scene
"CSO_ZE_Warning_MSG_723"		"Gerard: It's him!"
